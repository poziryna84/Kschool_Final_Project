# TotRms.AbvGrd, Bedroom.AbvGr, X1st.Flr.SF, X2nd.Flr.SF, Full.Bath are highly correlated with Gr.Liv.Area
# and some of them with each other. Therefore I will drop these variables:

# Garage and garage cars
ggpairs(data_full, columns = c( "SalePrice", "Garage.Cars", "Garage.Area")) # 0.887 - garage cars will be dropped


#Basement and its rooms and square feet and bathrooms:

# Total Basement square feet is very correlated with BsmtFin.Sf.1
# Therefore I am going to drop it.
