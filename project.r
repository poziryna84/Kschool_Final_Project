#Removing any variables that required special knowledge or previous calculations for their

#Only 80 variables remained and they are directly related to property sales.

#Most of the variables are exactly the type of information that a typical home buyer would want to know about
#a potential property (e.g. When was it built? How big is the lot? How many squarefeet of 
#living space is in the dwelling? Is the basement finished? How many bathrooms are there?).
